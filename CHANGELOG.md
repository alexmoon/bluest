# Change Log

## 0.5.7

- Fix Windows compilation error

## 0.5.6

- Added `Characteristic::max_write_len()` to get the maximum data that can be
  written to the characteristic in a single packet (this is 3 bytes less than
  the negotiated MTU for the connection; this is a method on the
  `Characteristic` instead of the `Device` because Linux only exposes this value
  on characteristics).
- Added limited support for `device_connection_events` on MacOS
- Tightened the behavior of the non-discover counterparts of discovery methods
  (i.e. `Device::services()`, `Service::characteristics()`,
  `Service::included_characteristics()`, `Characteristic::descriptors()`) to
  always perform discovery if discovery has not previously been performed.
- Fix docs.rs example scraping
