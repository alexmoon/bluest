#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! Bluest is a cross-platform [Bluetooth Low Energy] (BLE) library for [Rust]. It currently supports Windows (version
//! 10 and later), MacOS/iOS, and Linux. Android support is planned.
//!
//! The goal of Bluest is to create a *thin* abstraction on top of the platform-specific Bluetooth APIs in order to
//! provide safe, cross-platform access to Bluetooth LE devices. The crate currently supports the GAP Central and
//! GATT Client roles. Peripheral and Server roles are not supported.
//!
//! [Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
//! [Bluetooth Low Energy]: https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//!# use bluest::Adapter;
//!# use futures_lite::StreamExt;
//!# #[tokio::main]
//!# async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!let adapter = Adapter::default().await.ok_or("Bluetooth adapter not found")?;
//!adapter.wait_available().await?;
//!
//!println!("starting scan");
//!let mut scan = adapter.scan(&[]).await?;
//!println!("scan started");
//!while let Some(discovered_device) = scan.next().await {
//!    println!(
//!        "{}{}: {:?}",
//!        discovered_device.device.name().as_deref().unwrap_or("(unknown)"),
//!        discovered_device
//!            .rssi
//!            .map(|x| format!(" ({}dBm)", x))
//!            .unwrap_or_default(),
//!        discovered_device.adv_data.services
//!    );
//!}
//!#
//!#    Ok(())
//!# }
//! ```
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The primary functions provided by Bluest are:
//!
//! - Device discovery:
//!   - [Scanning][Adapter::scan] for devices and receiving advertisements
//!   - Finding [connected devices][Adapter::connected_devices]
//!   - [Opening][Adapter::open_device] previously found devices
//!   - [Connecting][Adapter::connect_device] to discovered devices
//!   - [Pairing][Device::pair] with devices
//! - Accessing remote GATT services:
//!   - Discovering device [services][Device::discover_services]
//!   - Discovering service [characteristics][Service::discover_characteristics]
//!   - Discovering characteristic [descriptors][Characteristic::discover_descriptors]
//!   - [Read][Characteristic::read], [write][Characteristic::write] (including
//!     [write without response][Characteristic::write_without_response]), and
//!     [notify/indicate][Characteristic::notify] operations on remote characteristics
//!   - [Read][Descriptor::read] and [write][Descriptor::write] operations on characteristic descriptors
//!
//! # Asynchronous runtimes
//!
//! On non-linux platforms, Bluest should work with any asynchronous runtime. On linux the underlying `bluer` crate
//! requires the Tokio runtime and Bluest makes use of Tokio's `block_in_place` API (which requires Tokio's
//! multi-threaded runtime) to make a few methods synchronous. Linux-only asynchronous versions of those methods are
//! also provided, which should be preferred in platform-specific code.
//!
//! # Platform specifics
//!
//! Because Bluest aims to provide a thin abstraction over the platform-specific APIs, the available APIs represent the
//! lowest common denominator of APIs among the supported platforms. For example, CoreBluetooth never exposes the
//! Bluetooth address of devices to applications, therefore there is no method on `Device` for retrieving an address or
//! even any Bluetooth address struct in the crate.
//!
//! Most Bluest APIs should behave consistently across all supported platforms. Those APIs with significant differences
//! in behavior are summarized in the table below.
//!

//!
//! ✅ = supported  
//! ✨ = managed automatically by the OS, this method is a no-op  
//! ⌛️ = the underlying API is async so this method uses Tokio's `block_in_place` API internally  
//! ❌ = returns a [`NotSupported`][error::ErrorKind::NotSupported] error
//!
//! Also, the errors returned by APIs in a given situation may not be consistent from platform to platform. For example,
//! Linux's bluez API does not return the underlying Bluetooth protocol error in a useful way, whereas the other
//! platforms do. Where it is possible to return a meaningful error, Bluest will attempt to do so. In other cases,
//! Bluest may return an error with a [`kind`][Error::kind] of [`Other`][error::ErrorKind::Other] and you would need to
//! look at the platform-specific [`source`][std::error::Error::source] of the error for more information.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! The `serde` feature is available to enable serializing/deserializing device
//! identifiers.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Examples demonstrating basic usage are available in the [examples folder].
